# hollandjs

## What is it?
 
It's a site for listing all js related events in the Netherlands.

## How can I add my event?

You send in a pull request _or_ you can create an issue,
then we will add it for you.

## If I send in a pull request, what should I do?

### Clone this repository

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/hollandjs/hollandjs.github.io.git
```

### Add a post in `_posts`

The filename should be formatted like so:

```bash
$ {year}-{month}-{day}-{title}.md
```

This boils down to the following:

```bash
$ 2018-01-01-wowjs.md
```


```md
---
layout: default
title: "wowjs"
date:   2018-01-01
venue: "The Barnhouse Amsterdam"
ticket: "free"
time: "7:30pm"
href: "http://www.meetup.com/asdasdasdasd"
---

```

### See what your post looks like

This site is created using [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/).
After you have installed `jekyll` you can serve the site on your own machine
using

```bash
$ jekyll serve
```

### What is this `pull request` you are talking about?

We can explain this, but github can [explain it better](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).
